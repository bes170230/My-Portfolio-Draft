                    <h3>B.S. in Software Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas, 2021</h3>

                    <p>I received my B.S. in Software Engineering last year from UTD. My area of concentration was cybersecurity, as I am fascinated by encryption and
                        the like. While I am grateful for the plethora of things I learned from my degree (especially Java and C++), I am also grateful for the 
                        opportunity to dive further into web development with Coding Temple. Web development was something I did not learn much about throughout
                        the course of my degree.

                    <h1>Previous Career</h1>
                    <h3>Personal training for 10+ years</h3>

                    <p>My previous career was serving as a personal trainer. I did this for 10+ years and loved it. It was astonishing to see how quickly people
                        who were commmitted could get results. I was inspired by the work ethic of my clients. My focus was on corrective exercise, i.e. posture
                        and how to solidify it so as to restore balance to the body. Seeing someone come in with severe arthritis, barely able to do a half-squat,
                        and leave my instruction able to do full-range-of-motion squats was gratifying.

                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                    <h3>Reading, working out, programming, and skiing are some of my top hobbies.</h3>
                    <p>In my spare time, you will catch me reading nonfiction. I am fascinated by philosophy and have read thousands of titles over
                        the years on my own. I also enjoy going to the gym, spending time with friends, skiing, programming, and much more.</p>
